# Part 3: Self-Discovery & Applied Exploration 
### In this section, you’ll try to independently research, experiment, and apply advanced SQL concepts. 
## **Subquery Exploration**
Goal: Understand what a subquery is and how it's used inside SQL commands. 

### What is a subquery in SQL? 
### Where can we use subqueries? (e.g., in SELECT, WHERE, FROM) 
 
### find all trainees whose emails appear in the applicants table. 
###### Use a subquery inside a WHERE clause. 

## **Extra Challenge:**

### DML statement (like UPDATE or DELETE) that uses a subquery in the WHERE clause. 
###### o Example: Delete all applicants whose email matches someone in the trainees table.
